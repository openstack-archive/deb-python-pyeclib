Description: interface for implementing erasure codes - Python 2.x
 This library provides a simple Python interface for implementing erasure
 codes. To obtain the best possible performance, the underlying erasure code
 algorithms are written in C.
 .
 This library makes use of Jerasure for Reed-Solomon and provides its own flat
 XOR-based erasure code encoder and decoder. Currently, it implements a
 specific class of HD Combination Codes (see "Flat XOR-based erasure codes in
 storage systems: Constructions, efficient recovery, and tradeoffs" in IEEE
 MSST 2010). These codes are well-suited to archival use-cases, have a simple
 construction and require a minimum number of participating disks during
 single-disk reconstruction (think XOR-based LRC code).
 .
 This package contains the Python 2.x module.
